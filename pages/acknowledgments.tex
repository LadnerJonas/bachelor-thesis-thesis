\noindent I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Maximilian Rieger, for his invaluable feedback and insightful ideas.
I am also very thankful to Prof.
Dr.
Thomas Neumann and the database chair for their excellent lectures, which sparked my interest in exploring database internals.

I am truly grateful to my family for their constant support throughout my educational journey.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends who have been by my side during my time at TUM.
